 * this script is indented to provide a secured mechanisms to reboot the initial local MNET key
 * when newly instanciated. This results in executing a primary $MNET->replace_keys(), so the new
 * instance has a valid own MNET setup. This script must be checked against security concerns as
 * not being accessible from any unkown host. The way we know our trusted master is to checkback
 * the incoming public key and search for a matching key in known hosts.
 *
 * This is a first security check that might not prevent for key steeling attacks.
 *
 * We cannot use usual MNET functions as impacting on behaviour of core mnet lib. this script can only be used once
 * at platform instanciation.
